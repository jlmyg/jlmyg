#  üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @jlmyg, people call me Loys for short. This is my short profile to showcase what I have achieved through my career.

## Software Testing

### Quality Assurance Engineer
  -  I have worked as a QA Engineer for 2 years and 4 months. During this span of time, I have learned test automation strategies ranging from non-functional and functional testing. Whitebox, blackbox, and greybox testing mainly focusing on end to end testing as well as API testing.

  #### Functional Testing
   - I have created Automated Test frameworks using Selenium, and Appium through Python and Robot Framework that mainly focuses on end to end UI tests. The testing framework we are using is Pytest.
   - The testing framework I mainly use follows Page Object Modelling, which is a manifestation of Object Oriented Programming principles that promotes reusability and scalability without the need of too much code maintenance as it's strenghts.
   - I also have written test cases and test scenarios whenever I am required to by our QA Manager.
  #### Non-Functional Testing
   - In this aspect, I have been working on our company's load testing through Locust. Which is a python-based testing tool that mocks API Requests through "swarms" to simulate multiple concurrent users to help diagnose the system performance.
   - Other aspects of non-functional testing I'm currently looking into is responsiveness testing. This is also through the same testing frameworks I've used mentioned above as Selenium also provides these capabilities.
   - Also contributed through automated cross-browser testing by adding the capabilities through the codebase.

#### Leadership
  - After 6 months of being a Junior QA Automation Engineer, I was promoted as the lead automation tester. During this time, I was able to achieve the following:
      - Streamlined Onboarding process for upcoming Automation Engineers that provides the adequate documentation of the current code base.
      - Led 6 automation engineers following Agile/Scrum methodology.
      - Collaborated with project managers and plan out related test cases to be automated.
      - Provided detailed reports of the team's deliverables for a certain sprint/quarter.
      - Draft testing plans and oversee the test execution through CICD.
      - Provide detailed test reports to project managers/product owners regarding the test results of smoke tests and full regression tests.

#### CI/CD
  -  Integrated continuous integratration for the automated test suite through Gitlab CICD
      - Executes smoke tests upon code merge to protected branches/test environments
      - Executes full regression tests through scheduled pipelines that gets executed at certain times of the week from different environments.

#### Career Growth üå±
 - I have joined workshops for Selenium with Java and Cucumber to understand the Gherkin/BDD approach of test automation.
 - I am also looking into qualifying for QA Certifications
